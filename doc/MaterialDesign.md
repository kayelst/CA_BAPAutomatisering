##Style-Colors
Color pallets have been designed to work harmoniously with eachother. It is suggested to use the 500 color as the primary color in your app and the other colors as accents colors.

###Color palette
All the color palletes start with a primary color and fills in the spectrum to create a complete and usable pallete for your app.
All color palettes should include sufficient contrast between different UI elements.


####500 Primary
500 is perfect for the dominant theme's and toolbars

####700 Statusbars
700 is perfect for header and statusbars

####300 Secondary
300 is perfect for secondary information on the page

###Color Schemes
Limit the selection of the colors to three hues from the primary palettes and one accent color from the secondary palette

##Accent Color
Accent colors are used to encourage user interaction. The color used should be a color from another color pallete.
